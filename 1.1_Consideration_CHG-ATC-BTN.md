## CAPTURE PAYMENT METHOD

Online stores that accept card payment may consider `payment capture = manually` (Allows you to authorise payment manually without charging to customer's card immediately), and if there's agreement that you are charging your customers in advance for a pre-order product that will ship at a later date, then you are able to capture funds immediately.
