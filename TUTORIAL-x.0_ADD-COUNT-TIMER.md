# ADD COUNT UP/DOWN TIMER
TUTORIAL X.0 `Add Count Up/Down Timer`

Self add a count timer that you can set the `end_date`. Mostly when there is a promotion scheduled for those special times. This snippet code can be added anywhere you'd like!

Even though there are apps for this feature in the web applications store, this is recommended for merchants who would like to have this go without pinching too much into their web development savings. The eAIDter team still uses this snippet code for such a situation as a solution.

You may freely write to our email at eaidter@gmail.com to hire us with minimal cost.
